In this project, the objective is to design a (single–input–single–output) discrete–time
controller for the pitch angle. For the design of pitch channnel, we ignore the coupling and
treat the yaw voltage as disturbance. In the next project, we design the yaw controller
and study the effects of coupling in simulations. More details in the project statements 1 & 2.
